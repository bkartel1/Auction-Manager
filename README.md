# Auction-Manager
Tools needed to run a live auction.  From loading items before the auction to cashiering after the auction.  This is a work in progress written in PHP.  I might try a complete re-write in Django to add more features to make the software even better.

A demo site will be listed soon for anyone interested to test the software.

I started creating this for a friends auction house and it is my first PHP program ever.  I first started using https://github.com/aejenner/auction-db-manager and transformed it along the way. I am more fluent in python so changing to Django will make it easier for me to modify the software and add many new features.  I would like to make this software versatile for everything from charity auctions to be able to run the biggest auctions around.
